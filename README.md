This will be a work in progress.

Why i did this? I have been working with linux since around 1998, and for some reason I've always avoided arch linux.  Over the past 6 months I started mining, anyone that knows me knows that I don't go the easy way ;) This was also an excuse for me to learn the power of arch linux and virtualbox \o/ 

We will end up creating a crypto miner system using virtualbox which will be much easier to work with rather than 100% on console :) 
Since I concentrate my mining with privacy based altcoins, I mine using AMD cards, yes RED TEAM :p So for my instructions as of right now I am only going to go over AMD drivers to start. This is not a complete step by step.  You will need some linux experience, otherwise you might find this alittle confusing. I will try my best to give credit where I can to everyone that I utilizing their code or tutorials.
